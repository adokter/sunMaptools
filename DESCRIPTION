Description: The suntools package provides a set of convenient functions for calculating sun-related information,
including the sun's position (elevation and azimuth), and the times of sunrise, sunset, solar noon, and twilight. 
These calculations are based on equations provided by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 
With suntools, users can determine important information about the sun for any given geographical location and time on Earth. 
The suntools package serves as a valuable resource for researchers, astronomers, and professionals working in fields such as
climatology, biology, and renewable energy.
